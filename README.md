# CacheClearer
A simple and easy to use tool that can clear your Windows 10 cache and help speed up your system.


# HOW TO USE
DON'T RUN CACHECLEARER.BAT IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE, IT MIGHT DELETE FILES AND FOLDERS THAT SHOULDNT BE TOUCHED


CacheClearer will ask if you want to delete all of Window's "normal cache". Answering yes to this will delete the contents of "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\", "C:\Windows\Temp\", "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\", and "C:\Windows\Prefetch\".

Afterwards, CacheClearer will run the Disk Cleanup application, just use it as normal. After this, CacheClearer will clear out the Microsoft store cache so that the store runs smoother, this will open up the Microsoft store on completion so don't be alarmed when it happens. CachClearer will then flush out all the uneeded DNS info so you can browse the internet better.

CachClearer will ask you if you want to delete the old Windows update folder and then the new Windows update folder. These folders are just old update data so deleting them should have no effect on your PC other than freeing up space.

CacheClearer will ask to delete all of the Discord cache. In doing so Discord will run a lot faster and smoother.

Finally it will ask you to delete Spotify cache. Doing this will make your Spotify application run faster and smoother.

After all of this, it is recommended to restart your computer.
